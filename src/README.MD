# MultiPath-TCP

## Overview
MultiPath-TCP is a networking project that implements or explores the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol, which enables simultaneous use of multiple network paths for improved throughput and reliability.

## Features
- Support for multiple concurrent network paths
- Load balancing across available connections
- Seamless failover between paths
- Improved network resilience

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection refused**: Ensure all network interfaces are properly configured
- **Path detection failure**: Verify network connectivity on all available paths
- **Load balancing uneven**: Check bandwidth constraints and path metrics

## Performance Metrics
- Throughput improvement with multiple paths
- Failover latency and recovery time
- CPU and memory overhead during operation

## Future Roadmap
- IPv6 support
- Enhanced congestion control algorithms
- Integration with container orchestration platforms
- Performance optimization for high-speed networks
